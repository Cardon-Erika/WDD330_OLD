        <h1>Week Two Notes - Novice to Ninja</h1>
        <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <strong>const</strong> when the variable be reassigned to another value.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>let</strong> if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
            <li><strong>var</strong> not really used anymore.</li>
            <li><strong>ANSWER</strong> different from <strong>Answer</strong> as well as <strong>answer</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>.length</strong> used to find the length of a string. Helpful with loops.</li>
            <li>Template literals are created with the backtick character `. You can use both types of quote marks
                inside. It also allows for interpolation of JavaScript code, so a JS expression can be inserted inside
                the string and the result will be displayed. IE, you can call variables into strings easily using
                <strong>${}</strong>.</li>
            <li>8 is different than '8'.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember, arrays start with 0.</li>
            <li>You can use <strong>.length</strong> to find the amount of items in an array.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>pop()</strong> method to remove the last item from an array.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>shift()</strong> method to remove the first item from an array.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>push()</strong> method to append a new value to the end of the array.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>unshift()</strong> method to append a new value to the beginning of the array.</li>
            <li><strong>sort()</strong> does not work the same for numbers. [1, 3, 12, 23, 41, 9] would list as [1, 12 ,23, 3, 41, 9].</li>
            <li>Use a switch statement to make a long list of if/else statements easier to test and read.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions reduce repetition. Yea!</li>
            <li>All functions need to be invoked to run. To do this type its name followed by parentheses.</li>
            <li>Keep your code DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.</li>
            <li>Can declare a function with arrow syntax with ES6. <strong>const square = x => x*x;</strong></li>
            <li><strong>forEach()</strong> can be used in place of a for loop to loop through each value in an array.</li>
            <li><strong>reduce()</strong> iterates over each value in an array and cumulatively combines each result to return just a single value. Can use to sum an array of numbers. This can also be paired with other methods to improve their usability, such as map() and mean().</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>When working on the week 3 group project, we had a hard time getting step 3 to work. After playing around with it and trying a number of different things (arrow function, spelled out if statement) we compared to the answer. We found that it worked with we used <strong>console.table</strong>, but not <strong>console.log</strong>. Why would that be?</p>
