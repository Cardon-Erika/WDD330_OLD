        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation: keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it's done.</li>
            <li>Polymorphism: various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
            <li>Inheritance: we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
        </ul>
