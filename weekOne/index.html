    <h1>Master Mobile UX</h1>
    <h2>Mobile First</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your
            core functionality." Joel Marsh</li>
        <li>Desktop was the only screen to develop for for 30+ years. In 2007, with the iPhone, suddenly new devices.
            Now, there are many different devices and screen sizes and resolutions.</li>
        <li>With mobile devices household have, on average, 2-3 devices per person.</li>
        <li>Just because your website is responsive doesn't mean it's mobile first.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Things to Remember</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011.</li>
        <li>You don't see people with their heads in laptops.</li>
        <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
        <li>Mobile is not a fad - we aren't suddenly going to get rid of our phones.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Understanding Users</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be there</li>
        <li>Be Useful</li>
        <li>Be Quick</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>How Do Users Handle Device - Reachabliity Matters</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>What can the user reach with the most common grips?</li>
        <li>Reduce image usage</li>
        <li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth</li>
        <li>Optimize and minimize CSS and JS files</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategic Menu Design</h2>
    <p>In a typical design, the nav menu is in one of the hardest to reach areas of the screen with a one-handed grip.
        Simply moving the nav menu to the bottom of the screen makes it easy to reach.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Friendly Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One easy option - ditch labels and use placeholder text instead. Also, float labels help make it concise.
        </li>
        <li>Large check boxes that are easy to hit with the thumb.</li>
        <li>Simplify, and cut out what isn't needed.</li>
        <li>Enable autocomplete.</li>
        <li>Unless you are in a very public place, people around you won't be able to see your passwords as you type
            them in. Set them to display by default, and allow users to hide if desired.</li>
        <li>Add spacing to credit card numbers and autoadvance to next field.</li>
        <li>Use the best keyboard for what the user is entering.</li>
        <li>Use anchor tag to link phone number so users can easily make a call.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mobile Advertising</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are placing ads in mobile content, make it small.</li>
        <li>Stop using pop-ups and popovers.</li>
        <li>Content first - users don't visit your site to look at ads.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I've seen many apps go back to the "nav on top" design. Is that mainly due to a preference of the designer?
            Or was it found that having the navigation on the bottom of the screen wasn't as useful as expected? Or
            other issues arose?</li>
        <li>Is the hamburger icon still obscure?</li>
    </ol>
