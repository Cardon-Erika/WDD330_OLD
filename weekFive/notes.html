        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors usually caused by 1 of 3 things</li>
            <ul>
                <li>System error - There is a problem with the system or external devices</li>
                <li>Programmer error - The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic</li>
                <li>User error - The user has entered data incorrectly</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Programmers should use strict mode so their code isn't sloppy. It is implemented with 'use strict'; You can put this at the beginning of hte .js file, or inside individual functions. Best method is the wrap all code inside a self-invoking function that invokes strict mode.</li>
            <li><em>Alert</em> can be a helpful tool for debugging, but is usually discouraged today as better method exist now.</li>
            <li><em>console.log()</em> is helpful with debugging; you can also implement console.trace() which will log an interactive stack trace.</li>
            <li>The <em>debugger</em> command is very useful. It creates breakpoints that pause the execution of the code and allow you to see what is happening in the code.</li>
            <li>Error objects can be created to give a message indicating what went wrong.</li>
            <li>Developing with test-driven development is a useful way to create new code.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Write tests (they will fail initially)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
